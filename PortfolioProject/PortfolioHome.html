        <p>A personal favorite project of mine deserving it's front and center placement on my portfolio. Made for a sociology final project, this video tackles the effects music has on the player and the impact the overall tone sets for the game it's made for. I discuss several different themes and game genres and how their music, and how over time with improvements to hardware, benefit the overall experience of the game. This was a fun project to put together, and I'm rather proud of how the final product came out to be.</p>

            <p>A project from my Sound Design classes. This project's goal was to implent only sound effects and background ambience/noise to be able to tell a complete narrative for first time listeners. In the end, my goal was to make a story implicating a prisoner being led to the gallows for a public execution, climaxing in a sudden beheading. A couple more added sound effects for clarification to first time viewers would probably have rounded out this project's finish more.</p>

            <p>Another project from Sound Design class. The goal of this project was to take an already existing piece of music that lasted 5+ minutes and to trim it down to at most 2 minutes while leaving it in tact enough that it still sounds like it could be the same complete song. Overall, a couple adjustments to timing could have been made as some middle sections are out of beat.</p>
